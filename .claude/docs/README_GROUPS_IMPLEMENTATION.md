## 💡 Key Concepts

### Permission Hierarchy
```
Owner (level 3)
├── Full control: delete group, manage all members
├── Can demote: admin, assistant, member
└── Cannot: be demoted or removed

Admin (level 2)
├── Can: add/remove members, change roles
├── Can demote: assistant, member
└── Cannot: delete group, modify owner

Assistant (level 1)
├── Can: view members
└── Cannot: modify anything

Member (level 0)
├── Can: view members, access shared resources
└── Cannot: modify anything
```

### Status Computation
```
active = is_active === true && !is_expired && !is_full
expired = expires_at < now
full = member_count >= max_members
inactive = is_active === false
```

### Role-Based Access Pattern
```typescript
// Always check permissions before rendering
const canManageMembers = computed(() => {
  return isOwner.value || isAdmin.value
})

// Always check permissions before action
const removeMember = async (member) => {
  if (member.role === 'owner') {
    error.value = t('groupDetail.cannotRemoveOwner')
    return
  }
  // ... proceed with removal
}
```

## 🚀 Recommended Implementation Order

### Why This Order?
1. **GroupDetail.vue** - Critical path, everything else depends on it
2. **Route** - Need this to navigate to GroupDetail
3. **GroupForm.vue** - Reusable component, clean separation
4. **useGroupMembers** - Business logic layer
5. **Terminal Sharing** - Feature expansion
6. **Terminal Filtering** - UX enhancement
7. **Entity.vue** - Polish and consistency

### Critical Path
```
GroupDetail.vue → Route → GroupForm.vue → useGroupMembers
    ↓
Terminal Sharing Integration → Terminal Filtering → Entity.vue
```

---

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- [ ] useGroupMembers permission checks
- [ ] Permission computed properties
- [ ] Validation functions

### Component Tests
- [ ] GroupDetail tab switching
- [ ] Modal open/close
- [ ] Form submission
- [ ] Permission-based UI rendering

### Manual Testing
- [ ] Happy path: Create group → Add member → Share terminal
- [ ] Permissions: Test each role separately
- [ ] Errors: Test each error scenario
- [ ] Edge cases: Empty, full, expired groups

### Checklists Provided
- ✅ 40+ manual testing scenarios
- ✅ Security validation checklist
- ✅ Accessibility checklist
- ✅ Performance checklist
- ✅ i18n validation checklist

## 📞 Common Questions

**Q: Should I implement all 7 steps at once?**
A: No, implement in recommended order. You can deploy steps 1-4 without 5-7.

**Q: What if the backend API changes?**
A: The types and error handling are documented. Adjust in one place (store or composable).

**Q: How do I handle network errors?**
A: See error handling strategy in GROUPS_QUICK_REFERENCE.md and GROUP_DETAIL_SPECIFICATION.md.

**Q: What about mobile responsiveness?**
A: Fully documented in GROUP_DETAIL_SPECIFICATION.md with breakpoints and examples.

**Q: How do I test feature flags?**
A: See GROUPS_QUICK_REFERENCE.md for testing instructions.

**See GROUPS_QUICK_REFERENCE.md for 20+ more Q&A.**

## 🔐 Security & Permissions

### Must Enforce
```
✓ Only owner can delete group
✓ Only admin/owner can add members
✓ Cannot demote owner to other role
✓ Cannot remove owner from group
✓ Cannot modify higher role as lower role
✓ Permission checks on every API call
✓ Feature flag prevents unauthorized access
```

### Must Validate
```
✓ Display name required and length-checked
✓ Max members bounds validated
✓ Expiry date not in past
✓ Role values are valid enum
✓ User IDs exist
✓ Group IDs exist
```

---

## ✨ Code Quality Standards

### Follow These Patterns
```typescript
// ✓ Use asyncWrapper for all async operations
const loadMembers = asyncWrapper(async () => {
  // ...
}, store, 'groupDetail.loadError', 'Loading members')

// ✓ Use useTranslations for i18n
const { t } = useTranslations({ en: {...}, fr: {...} })

// ✓ Use relative imports
import { useClassGroupsStore } from '../../stores/classGroups'

// ✓ Use CSS variables
background-color: var(--color-primary)

// ✓ Use proper TypeScript types
const members: GroupMember[] = []

// ✓ Check feature flags
if (!isEnabled('class_groups')) return
```
